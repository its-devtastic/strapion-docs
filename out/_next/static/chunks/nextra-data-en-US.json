Strapion\nprovides an alternative admin that is built with React and easy to customize and extend. It uses popular frameworks and\nlibraries that should be familiar to many developers. The goal of Strapion is not to be a full replacement of Strapi's\nown admin. Creating content types, setting up login providers and other plugin management tasks are things that content\ncreators never have to deal with. These features only confuse most admin users. Instead, Strapion wants to be the \"third wheel\"\nin the Jamstack relationship: the frontend (e.g. Next.js), the API (Strapi) and the content management UI (Strapion).","limitations#Limitations":"Strapion is not a drop-in replacement of the Strapi admin, and for two reasons. The first reason is that Strapion targets\ncontent creators and does not support features such as content creation and plugin settings. But another reason is that\nStrapion takes a different approach on how to configure the admin. Instead of putting all configuration in the database -\nmaking it hard to migrate between environments, do translations, etc. - Strapion takes most configuration from a single\nconfiguration object."}},"/configuration":{"title":"Configuration","data":{"":"Strapion is very customizable. Most of the configuration is done by modifying the strapion.config.ts file. If you've\nused the Create Strapion App tool it will have created it for you. To make managing the config a bit easier it also extracted\nsome files to a config folder. This is just for convenience, feel free to arrange it as you see fit."}}}
